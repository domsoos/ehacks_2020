# ehacks_2020
Our project for eHacks 2020 hackathon

# How it works
A-EYE Disease Recognition

# How we built it
Julien and Elliott worked on the front-end while Matvey and Dominik figured out the machine learning part of our project.

# Challenges we ran into
We ran into some challenges figuring out details with the camera in front-end as well as tuning the hyperparameters for our Neural Network to fit the Dataset. Eventually we solved all the problems, but we still have a lot more to do.
